# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects demonstrating various image transformation techniques. Each project includes code and examples for different transformations and manipulations using popular libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy.

## Project Overview

### Affine Transformation
- **Description:** Applies an affine transformation to images, which includes translation, scaling, rotation, and shearing.
- **Key Concepts:** Matrix operations, linear transformations, and coordinate mapping.
- **Usage:** Run the `affine_transformation.py` script to apply affine transformations to sample images.

### Shear Transformation
- **Description:** Implements shear transformation to distort images by shifting pixels along the x or y axis.
- **Key Concepts:** Shear matrix, affine transformations, and image distortion.
- **Usage:** Execute the `shear_transformation.py` script to apply shear transformations.

## File Structure

- `affine_transformation.py` - Python script for affine transformation.
- `shear_transformation.py` - Python script for shear transformation.
- `sample_images/` - Directory containing sample images used for testing.
- `README.md` - This file with project details.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
